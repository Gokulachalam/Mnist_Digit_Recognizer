# MNIST WITH COMPLETE UI SETUP

## Dataset Description

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

## Libraries Used

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Keras
* Sklearn
* gzip
* joblib
* Random

# Steps Done

1. Fetching The Dataset.

we can import from the local library but it will take too much time for loading . To prevent this we are fetching the datasetfrom the openml.

2. Splitting The Dataset,

3. Reshaping The Dataset.

4. Modelling the Classifier Model - Classification.

5. Evaluation is done by using the evaluation metrics.

6. Dumping the model by using the joblib library.

7. Creating the GUI for the user interaction.
